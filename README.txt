This Java package contains the code of Hierarchical Affinity Propagation for Segmentation or HAPS system described in my COLING 2014 paper. 

I tried not to include external code to the extent possible and because of that this is a bare-bones package 
that does not contain the code using a number of external resources for benchmarking, evaluating or computing similarities more intelligently.
If you need that code please contact me.
